<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year undergraduate student in the School of Computer Science and Technology at [HUST](https://english.hust.edu.cn/). I began my research journey while collaborating with Prof. [Yao Wan](http://wanyao.me/) at HUST, and join his undergraduate team, [One Lab](https://oneslab.github.io/).
At present, I am working with Prof. [Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/) at [UMD](https://umd.edu/). 
I am currently seeking a Ph.D position in Machine Learning for Fall 2026.

My research interests lie in the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Software Engineering**, especially on 
- **Reasoning**: reasoning interpretability, code reasoning, mllm reasoning.
- **Code Intelligence** : code generation, code execution.
- **Trustworthy AI** : interpretability, knowledge editing.

Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13tjEFEF5Lehm8jajiyQTGLJJwD3h7v7K/view?usp=drive_link). Please feel free to contact me!
